## A list stores many values in a single structure.

*   Doing calculations with a hundred variables called `pressure_001`, `pressure_002`, etc.,
    would be at least as slow as doing them by hand.
*   Use a *list* to store many values together.
    *   Contained within square brackets `[...]`.
    *   Values separated by commas `,`.

~~~
pressures = [0.273, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]
print('pressures:', pressures)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
pressures: [0.273, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]
~~~
{: .output}

## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a list.

~~~
print(len(pressures))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
5
~~~
{: .output}

*   Nested functions are evaluated from the inside out,
    just like in mathematics.

## Use an item's index to fetch it from a list.

*   Each position in the list (first, second, etc.) is given a number. This
    number is called an index.
*   Indices are numbered from 0.
*   Use the position's index in square brackets to get the item at that
    position.
*   Note that the words item and element are often used interchangeably.

~~~
print('zeroth item of pressures:', pressures[0])
print('fourth item of pressures:', pressures[4])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
zeroth item of pressures: 0.273
fourth item of pressures: 0.276
~~~
{: .output}

## Indexing in Python is from zero

Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1
because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
[Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
As a result,
if we have a Python list with M elements,
its indices go from 0 to M-1.
It takes a bit of getting used to,
but one way to remember the rule is that
the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.

## Use slicing to fetch multiple items from a list.

*   A part of a list is called a list slice. A list slice can be as short as a
    single item.
*   We take a slice by using `[start:stop]`, where `start` is replaced with the
    index of the first item we want and `stop` is replaced with the index of
    the item just after the last item we want.
*   Mathematically, you might say that a slice selects `[start:stop)`.
*   The difference between stop and start is the slice's length.
*   Taking a slice does not change the contents of the original list. Instead,
    the slice is a copy of part of the original list.

~~~
pressures[0:3]
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
[0.273, 0.275, 0.277]
~~~
{: .output}

## Lists' values can be replaced by assigning to them.

*   Use an index expression on the left of assignment to replace a value.

~~~
pressures[0] = 0.265
print('pressures is now:', pressures)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
pressures is now: [0.265, 0.275, 0.277, 0.275, 0.276]
~~~
{: .output}

## Appending items to a list lengthens it.

*   Use `list_name.append` to add items to the end of a list.

~~~
primes = [2, 3, 5]
print('primes is initially:', primes)
primes.append(7)
primes.append(9)
print('primes has become:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes is initially: [2, 3, 5]
primes has become: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
~~~
{: .output}

*   `append` is a *method* of lists.
    *   Like a function, but tied to a particular object.
*   Use `object_name.method_name` to call methods.
    *   Deliberately resembles the way we refer to things in a library.
*   We will meet other methods of lists as we go along.
    *   Use `help(list)` for a preview.
*   `extend` is similar to `append`, but it allows you to combine two lists.  For example:

~~~
teen_primes = [11, 13, 17, 19]
middle_aged_primes = [37, 41, 43, 47]
print('primes is currently:', primes)
primes.extend(teen_primes)
print('primes has now become:', primes)
primes.append(middle_aged_primes)
print('primes has finally become:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes is currently: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
primes has now become: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19]
primes has finally become: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, [37, 41, 43, 47]]
~~~
{: .output}

Note that while `extend` maintains the "flat" structure of the list, appending a list to a list makes the result two-dimensional.

## Use `del` to remove items from a list entirely.

*   `del list_name[index]` removes an item from a list and shortens the list.
*   Not a function or a method, but a statement in the language.

~~~
print('primes before removing last item:', primes)
del primes[4]
print('primes after removing last item:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes before removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
primes after removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7]
~~~
{: .output}

## The empty list contains no values.

*   Use `[]` on its own to represent a list that doesn't contain any values.
    *   "The zero of lists."
*   Helpful as a starting point for collecting values
    (which we will see in the [next episode]({{page.root}}/09-for-loops/)).

## Lists may contain values of different types.

*   A single list may contain numbers, strings, and anything else.

~~~
goals = [1, 'Create lists.', 2, 'Extract items from lists.', 3, 'Modify lists.']
~~~
{: .python}

## Character strings can be indexed and sliced like lists.

*   The characters (individual letters, numbers, and so on) in a string are
    ordered. For example, the string 'AB' is not the same as 'BA'. Because of
    this ordering, we can treat the string as a list of characters.
*   Get characters from a character string using indexes and slices in square brackets.
*   The built-in function `len` counts the number of characters in a string.

~~~
element = 'carbon'
print('zeroth character:', element[0])
print('sub-string:', element[1:4])
print('length:', len(element))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
zeroth character: c
sub-string: arb
length: 6
~~~
{: .output}

*   But numbers don't have a length (not even zero).

~~~
print(len(52))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<ipython-input-3-f769e8e8097d> in <module>()
----> 1 print(len(52))

TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
~~~
{: .error}

## Character strings are immutable.

*   You cannot change the characters in a string after it has been created.
    *   *Immutable*: can't be changed after creation.
    *   In contrast, lists are *mutable*: they can be modified in place.
*   Python considers the string to be a single value with parts,
    not a collection of values.

~~~
element[0] = 'C'
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
~~~
{: .error}

*   Lists and character strings are both *collections*.

## Indexing beyond the end of the collection is an error.

*   Python reports an `IndexError` if we attempt to access a value that doesn't exist.
    *   This is a kind of [runtime error]({{ page.root }}/05-error-messages/).
    *   Cannot be detected as the code is parsed
        because the index might be calculated based on data.
